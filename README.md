Hereâ€™s an updated `README.md` file tailored to the code and functionality of your AI chatbot built with Expo and React Native:

---

# **AI Chatbot App** ðŸ¤–

This is an **AI Chatbot** built using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev). It leverages the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/) for generating responses, enabling seamless conversational interactions. 

---

## **Features**
- Real-time AI-powered chatbot with conversational capabilities.
- User-friendly interface designed for mobile devices.
- Dynamic chat interface with a scrollable message history.
- Secure integration with OpenAI API using environment variables.

---

## **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to run the app locally:

### **1. Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### **2. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### **4. Set Up Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

```env
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### **5. Start the App**
Launch the development server:
```bash
npx expo start
```

Choose how to run the app:
- **Development build** for testing on physical devices.
- **iOS Simulator** or **Android Emulator**.
- **Expo Go** for quick previews.

## **Project Structure**

```
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                # Main app directory with screen and routing files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ HomeScreen.js   # The main chatbot screen
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/     # Reusable components (e.g., ChatMessage)
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/             # Static assets like images and icons
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                # Environment variables (OpenAI API key)
â”œâ”€â”€ App.js              # Entry point for the application
â”œâ”€â”€ babel.config.js     # Babel configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json        # Project dependencies and scripts
```

## **Development**

### **File-based Routing**
The project uses [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) for file-based routing. Add new screens inside the `app/` directory to extend functionality.

### **Chatbot Logic**
The AI interaction logic is located in `HomeScreen.js`, which:
1. Sends user input to OpenAI using the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model.
2. Updates the chat history dynamically for both user and AI responses.

### **Styling**
All UI components are styled using the `StyleSheet` API from React Native, ensuring consistency across platforms.
